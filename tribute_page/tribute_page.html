                <h3>Here's a time line of Vincent van Gogh's early life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1853</strong> - born on 30 March 1853 into a Dutch Reformed Church family in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1864</strong> - was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen,[27] where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1866</strong> - his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was deeply unhappy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1868</strong> - he abruptly returned home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1876</strong> - he returned to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1877</strong> - the family sent him to live with his uncle Johannes Stricker, a respected theologian, in Amsterdam.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1880</strong> - returned to Cuesmes. He became interested in the people and scenes around him, and he recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1880</strong> - registered at the Acad√©mie where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.
                    </li>
